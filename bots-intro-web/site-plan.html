      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The site is going to give an overview to robotics. It's going to explain
        about some of the things that the robots can do. Or the advantages of doing 
        robotics. Also I'm going to present a brief explanation of my experience working
        with a robot in a basic way. The robot was programed with Arduino language and 
        it's very practical. It has different sensors to detect what is happenning 
        arround it. These sensors are, for example: ultrasound, infrared, photoresistors,
        etc. I'm going to number which are the compinents that helped me to make my robot, 
        as the Arduino plate, leds, cables, battery, wheels, dc motors, and the structure to 
        carry all this components (I made a certificate that gives an organization from my country teaching robotics
        and I've already talked with them: I can show my project with their brand, but not us it to start a new company coping their work)
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience are all the people who are interested in robots and
        find interesting to know a little more about the field. No matter the age.
        The audience are the people who want something new but not too complex and 
        not too expensive. An ArduinoUno plate, for example, it's 5 dollars. They 
        want to be part of the future programming robots and this is a good start.
        The audience that are going to read and watch my site are going to access
        through the computers, phones, laptops, tablets, and every mobile device. 
        This site is not going to teach them the steps to make a robot, but to
        have a first contact with it.

        Well, to be sicere, I inspected the web page from where I learned how to make a robot. And tried to copy the same. But in the way I have found other type of fonts that appeared to be very interesting. And I stay with this one. It's seems formal and futuristic.<!-- change this -->

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Ubuntu  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font it's awesome for the paragraphs because it's very technological. The fonts inspires the people to enter more deeply in the robotic field. At least in the explanaition about the experience making the robot. <!-- change this -->

          <p><mark>What does my robot do?</mark></p>
          <p>Well, my robot does many interesting things: 

            <li>Turns the red, and white LEDs on as the turning light of a car. Also has an RGB (red, green and blue) LED, that combines its three colors to form almost any color.</li>
            <li>Moves on two wheels with DC motors. </li>
            <li>Uses the ultrasonic sensor that makes the robot “realize” how long an object is in front of it. It has a range from 2 – 400 cm ahead of it. </li>
            <li>Follows a black line from the floor with the infrared sensors. </li>
            <li>Follows the light of a flashlight in the darkness.</li>
            <li>Receives the instructions from a remote control to move forward, move backward, turn left and turn right. As well as the stop option.</li>
          </p>
      
          <p><mark>How does “he” do that?</mark></p>
          <p>
            I think that the first thing to start answering all of your questions about how does the robot works, is the Arduino Plate. The robot needs instructions to move, turn LEDs on in measured amount of times and a bunch of things! And to store, comprehend and fulfill those instructions it needs a “brain”. There is where the Arduino plate comes! The sensors receive values and we have to work with them; for example, if the ultrasonic sensor detects an object at 50cm, we would want our robot to turn left (or right if you prefer). We have to program with the computer in Arduino language and send it to the plate through a USB cable so our robot knows what he is going to respond to the information that the sensors give.</p>
          </p>
    
          <p><mark>Some tips</mark></p>
          <p>
            <li>Have in mind that everything is proof and error, not everything has to be perfect in the first time. </li>
            <li>Be careful with the parts of the robot, they are delicate. </li>
            <li>Be patience and take your time. I suggest to do a little bit every day, like an hour or half of it at minimum. In that way you’ll get very in touch with your project. </li>
            <li>Look for help. There is always somebody who can help you. </li>
            <li>Start with the easier things and then with the more difficult things. I know we want our robot to do amazing things at the beginning, but start simple because if not you are going to stress quickly.</li>
            <li>Don’t worry to investigate and learn from the ideas of other people, because that is the way we learn!</li>

        <p><mark>Components</mark></p>

  <p>
    Well, I had to use many things to get my robot done. And here is a list of them:		
    </p>
    <li>Arduino UNO board</li>
    <li>USB Cable</li>
    <li>Breadboard 400 pts</li>
    <li>Jack cable - 9v battery</li>
    <li>DC motor and wheel</li>
    <li>White Led 5 mm.</li>
    <li>RGB Led 5 mm.</li>
    <li>Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04</li>
    <li>Infrared Sensor TCRT5000</li>
    <li>Photoresistance LDR 5 mm.</li>
    <li>Red Led 5 mm.</li>
    <li>Dual H Bridge L9110s</li>
    <li>Remote control (model may vary)</li>
    <li>Infrared receiver (model may vary)</li>
    <li>Resistance 10Ω - 180Ω - 220Ω - 270Ω - 330Ω</li>
    <li>M-M cable 10 and 20 cm. / Cable H-M 10 and 20 cm.</li>

    <p>
      
All of this components came with the kit that the BOTS course gives when you buy them, and also with the structure of the robot (wheels, plastic structure, chassis, bolts, etc.); but you can get these things buying them separately online. <br>If you want a complete guide of how to code in Arduino click <strong><a>here</a></strong>. The BOTS course is from Argentina and teaches the mechatronic and programming, but you can learn with the Arduino site. And they also give certificates.
