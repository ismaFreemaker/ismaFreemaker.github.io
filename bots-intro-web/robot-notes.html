      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hello! How are you? Are you curious about robots? They are amazing in the movies, aren't they? And what about in the reality? Would you want to know more about them? And what about to create your own one? Well, I would like to tell you my experience when I learned how to make a robot with <a>BOTS</a>(link) educational organization. It was an amazing adventure. I knew zero about coding, mecatronic, sensors and stuff. But little by little I was taught how to do it and accept the challenges. And if I could do it, you can do it better than me! <br>
